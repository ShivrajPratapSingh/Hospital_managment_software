Hello there , this is where we will be storing our CS project for class 12 . We have decided to make a hospital mental health management sysmtem , this works in a menu driven system. 
using the menue you can perform many fuction like

1. Adding doctor to the "register"
2. adding information about said doctor
3. adding factors about mental health
4. a rating system which use all factors and model a assumption for the current mental health of a perticular doctor or the complete hospital as a whole. out of 100
5. a solution page ,
